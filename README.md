# Personal user manual
This document serves as a brief introduction to what I value and believe in as a Software Engineer. It can help us to establish a relationship, but it won’t replace getting to know each other through 1:1s, day-to-day chat

## Communication
- Chat is perfect. Mail is also a good option. Phone is for emergencies. I have a strong analytical mind, so often I need time to get into context and fully understand your problem. Because of this, async communication works best for me.
- Feel free to ping me when I don't respond for too long. 
- I love working and communicating through design documents. 
- All of those async communication cannot replace good old meeting with blackboard and diagrams. Love to see how things work, communicate and are placed in larger picture

## Feedback
- I love giving and receiving feedback. 
- Best feedback is live feedback, so don't hesitate and wait with giving it to me. For sure, I won’t wait.
- I like getting feedback face to face, but if you don't feel comfortable, simply message it to me ;) 
- My opinions are, only opinions. Discuss, argue, let us learn together.

## Working hours
- I tend to work between 08:00 to 16:00 CET/CEST
- Those hours are not written in stone, and I am flexible, so I can accommodate those working hours to the team schedule

## What I need to be efficient at work
- I need a clear goal. I am an achiever by heart, so I will work tirelessly in order to achieve our goals.
- I need some degree of freedom to choose topics and tasks that resonates with me. 
- I need time for analysis. As I mentioned before, I have a highly analytical mind. I love data, and I need time to understand them and draw conclusions.
- I need space for creativity. 
- Most importantly, I need a team to talk about my ideas 

## How to help me
- I am highly creative, and sometimes I can get lost in my ideas and possibilities. If this happens, please stop me, and bring me to earth
- Sometimes I get sidetracked, and I tend to jump on a side quests. If I get carried away and my work no longer serves the team or organization, please tell me immediately. 
- I tend to struggle with relationship building and meeting new people. I will accept any help here ;)

## What I value
- I love learning new things, and I am really curious person
- I value honesty and openness
- I don't believe in blaming people. We can always fix what's not working.
- I value people that can change their mind when data is clearly against them
- I believe that all people are equal, and I can't stand when someone isn't treating me seriously
